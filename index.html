									<h2 class="major">SANTA MONICA, FEBRUARY 2025</h2>
									<p>Change is coming to the beaches of coastal LA.
										<br><br>
										After a tumultuous first season of Division I football, the Santa Monica Surfriders have struggled to find their place in the refreshed Pac 12.
										<br><br>
										The Division - now named the Pac 6 - once again looked to the pacific coastline for inspiration in filling out the ranks, featuring fellow debutantes to the FBS level: the Alaska Nanooks, Vancouver Fighting Geese, and Seattle Sea Slugs.

									<h2 class="major">O - 14</h2>
									<p>The Surfriders started on a positive note in the season opener, with a closely fought loss to Colorado State at home - it didn't take long, however, for the mood to deteriorate with blow out losses to multiple FCS teams, the biggest of which to longstanding rivals the Riverside Royals.
										<br><br>It's possible their snubbing from promotion in favour of The Surf left a bad taste that needed addressing. Ultimately the team would end the season winless, a major headache for incumbent rookie head coach Philip Rivers.

									<h2 class="major">ALL FAME, NO FORTUNE</h2>
									<p>Senior Quarterback Austin Oakley being surrounded in off-the-field controversies certainly didn't help the team find success on the field. The 6’5 220lb gunslinger, largely responsible for the team’s miraculous ascent to the major leagues, had not seemed his usual upbeat self around camp. The narrative prior to the season revolved around the harmony between raw talent at QB paired with vast experience at that same position in their Head Coach - it's clear that reports of that harmony were overblown. <br><br> Sources from inside the camp suggested that the young prospect was more concerned with his newfound fame and fortune; in part due to a NIL deal being struck with a popular sunglasses brand of a similar name. With Oakley looking towards the NFL draft, a new face will be taking the reigns for the 25 season in Santa Monica.

									<p>The work has already begun for Coach Rivers and the massively overturned roster of the Surfriders. 21 Seniors graduated the newly founded University of Santa Monica. A further 17 players would leave via the transfer portal for greener pastures, and after the dismal season in 24, who could blame them?<br><br>A total of 35 replacements have committed to the school, all of which embarked on the 16 hour bus ride to Capitol Peak.								</div>

									<p>Philip is well versed with the effects of playing football at high altitude, playing at mile high every year of his 17 season career with the chargers. <br>
										He is hoping the extra conditioning will help his team maintain intensity late into games back on the coast.
									<br><br>
									“Shoot, we would hang in there for about 3 quarters, keeping the score close, and then there would be a fumble… or a pick, or… <br>these teams have got the coaches and the facilities, they can go late if they have to, we gotta be a bit more creative if we want to level the playing field”.
